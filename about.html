      <h1>About Dollah Cafe</h1>
      <p>Dollah Café began its journey in 2014 as a humble drink stall at a food court in Belawai. Initially focused on quenching thirst with simple beverages, the stall quickly gained a loyal following for its friendly service and quality offerings.</p>
      <p>Over time, the family behind the stall decided to expand their menu and transform the small business into a full-fledged café. Today, Dollah Café stands proudly next to the owner’s house, offering not just drinks but a variety of hearty dishes such as nasi goreng, mee goreng, and more.</p>
      <p>Despite its growth, the café remains a family-operated business, with every aspect—from cooking to serving—managed by family members. This personal touch has made Dollah Café a warm and welcoming spot for locals and visitors alike.</p>

    <h2>Our Signature Creation</h2>
    <p>The café is best known for its signature dessert, <strong>ABC Tinggi</strong> or <strong>ABC Viral</strong>, a towering shaved ice creation that has captured the hearts (and social media feeds) of many. While the café’s vibrant dessert has gained viral fame, Dollah Café is also cherished as a community space where people can lepak, enjoying good food, great company, and the relaxed atmosphere of a family-run business.</p>
